                        <p>Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1878 in Ulm, Germany- His parents Herman and Rauline Einstein were very worried about young Einstein because he was very slow to lean*1 how to speak. When he was young he had no mark of being genius. He was the worst in class. When he was young his paifents moved several times looking for a place to open businesses. His parents settled in Italy when he was 15. He soon w*ras expelled from school in Germany and joined his family in Italy. He finished high school in Switzerland; where he graduated with a teaching degree from the “Swiss Federal Institufte of Technology.” However he did not find a job until 1902. At the Swiss patent office, he worked there for seven years. lfln 1903, he married Maria Marie. Albt’ert Einstein conceptualized the theories of general relativitfty and special relativity. He came to realize that the univers^e was not made up of three dimensional space as was corflnmonly accepted, but four dimensional space-time. The fouirth dimension being that of time. Einstein made other great di iiscoveries, such as the speed of light.

                    <p>One of the most famous and prolific inventors of all time, Thomas Alva Edison exerted a tremendous influence on modern life, contributing inventions such as the incandescent light bulb, the phonograph, and the motion picture camera, as well as improving the telegraph and telephone. In his 84 years, he acquired an astounding 1,093 patents. Aside from being an inventor, Edison also managed to become a successful manufacturer and businessman, marketing his inventions to the public. A myriad of business liaisons, partnerships, and corporations filled Edison's life, and legal battles over various patents and corporations were continuous. The following is only a brief sketch of an enormously active and complex life full of projects often occurring simultaneously. Several excellent biographies are readily available in local libraries to those who wish to learn more about the particulars of his life and many business ventures.

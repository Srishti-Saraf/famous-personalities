                        <p>Nicholas Lowinger won the Youth Award in 2015 for his work and founding of the Gotta Have Soul Foundation. Nicholas met two siblings, a girl and a boy, who were homeless and unable to attend school regularly. They had one pair of shoes between them so they took turns wearing them to school every other day. Nicholas was heartbroken and gave the boy the shoes off his own feet. But one kind gesture wasnâ€™t enough, he also founded the Gotta Have Soul Foundation in 2010. In the past 10 years, he has put shoes on over 100,000 children in homeless shelters across every state in the US.

                        <p>Trisha Prabhu is barely a teenager today, however her inspiring journey began at the age of 13. Her breakthrough moment came when she heard of the death of a 12-year-old girl from Florida. Rebecca, like Trisha and many others, was a victim of cyberbullying for over a year and a half. Unable to take it anymore, Rebecca committed suicide, leaving Trisha shocked, heartbroken and outraged. This led Trisha to create ReThink, a technology that detects online hate and stops it before anyone gets hurt. Her efforts were recognized by President Obama in 2016, leading to Trisha presenting at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit.

                        <p>Once, a young school boy was caught in a fire accident in his 
                        school and was assumed that he would not live. His mother was told that he was sure 
                        to die, for the terrible fire had devastated the lower half of his body. Even if he
                         were to survive, he would be a cripple throughout his life.
                        But the brave boy did not want to die nor did he want to be a cripple. His 
                        determination to walk was indomitable and his persistence finally paid off. He
                        began to walk to school, then run to school, to run for the sheer joy of running.
                         Later in college he made the track team. In February 1934, in New York City’s famed
                          Madison Square Garden, this young man who was not expected to survive, 
                          who would surely never walk, who could never hope to run – this determined
                           young man, Dr. Glenn Cunningham, ran the world’s fastest mile.
